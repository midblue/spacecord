This week, my server has been getting chased around by a much bigger Green faction ship!
They keep tracking our movements, and taking potshots at us whenever they can. Luckily, our pilots are pretty great, and they're keeping us mostly safe. Everyone else has been taking night classes in piloting to help us stay that way.
We took a crew vote and decided we needed to broadcast an SOS, hoping that a ship friendly to our Yellow faction would hear it and come to help.
There was a close call where the enemy took out our engines, and we had to get all hands on deck to repair them before the enemy could take out more of our equipment while we sat still, defenseless.
After weeks of playing cat-and-mouse and with our health ever-dwindling, we were on the verge of broadcasting a surrender signal and letting the pirates have their way with our stores.
Suddenly, two new ships appeared on our radar. A pair of Yellow faction ships traveling together from a nearby planet swooped down upon the Green ship, instantly bringing down its shields.
It used a teleport beacon to escape, but we didn't mind. We were just happy to be alive. We'll always be watching out for that ship from now on.
The Yellow ships helped us repair our broken engines, and told us about a planet only a few AU away. We went there all together, with the Yellow ships slowing down to match our limping pace.
Once we arrived, we discovered that our cargo was valued extremely highly on this planet! We offloaded our cargo and managed to make enough money to upgrade our ship with a slick new laser weapon â€” Green faction had better wach their backs.
I couldn't understand exactly what they were saying because they were Gray faction, but I think there's something interesting happening a few dozen AU from here. The crew seems ready, so we load back up and blast off, ready to face whatever comes.

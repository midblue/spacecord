skiffs for individual players to go off and do their own thing within a certain range of the main server ship
also big thing was the messages in the main bot channel quickly overwhelming, said training and looking at shops etc stuff should be in DMs
suggested that users with the skiffs could go do mining themselves (minigame style of course) and bring back resources, way to feel productive toward the ship as an individual in a more material-feeling way than just leveling up your stats
add some stat like 'contribution points' which give you more abilities/say in votes/something, w the main thing being an equivalent to WoW i thought of, like hitting level 20 and being able to get a mount letting you know you've kinda crossed into the next level of gameplay where you have more freedom and ability to do stuff, hitting a certain contribution level would grant you your own vessel in the form of a skiff

skiffs
  ship needs "skiff docking bay" or something?
  what are the meaningful things you could do with a skiff?
    mine
    pew pew fight (untargetable but low damage)
    upgrade
      speed
      range from ship
      "efficiency"
      recharge speed
      weapon

**BUGS**
* i can train for someone else from .me
* cache not giving me the stuff
* undefined undefined in cargo
munitions can keep going after game over
minigames aren't set up for PM
most commands don't play nicely with PM
crashes on poll if no send access to .usethischannel channel

set trajectory to any planet

**MVP**
actual minigames for piloting and repairing
more equipment
more planets
a way to make money (quests?)
actually write help guide

**NEXT**
athletics skill for stamina gain and ...?
ship chatter on the different decks
mine ore from environment (and also use mining laser as weapon)
more html based scanners
jettison equipment too
tractor beam item
single-use items
	teleporters
	trackers
	booby trap cache
implement map
more other ship interaction options
	repair
implement food
legacy system: keep track of user action count
black holes that suck more if u weigh more
see all docked ships on a planet
global leaderboard
status report on ship
cantina & cantina chatter (report)
auto-healing gear
solar panels

piloting
  angry birds style launcher but you type in degrees and power
  bounce in straight lines through a maze (or like pool?)
repair
  get lots of broken parts of a string that you have to rearrange by typing like 41325 or something
  crossword fill in the blank - get a clue and some letters filled in
  follow complex set of directions (i.e. a manual) (manipulate something) (logic rules) to get simple answer ('XXYXYXX')
  math puzzle
  minesweeper
  connect wires

dice based game


colonize/adopt a planet and have passive things being gathered or whatever

space for equipment vs space for cargo in chasses
tiers of gas, tiers of minerals


MVP
set bot activity channel/s
reactions to take actions
world automatically expands as servers join so we keep a generally even level of encounter rate
make sure to completely divorce game logic from discord logic

load entire world in chunks and update in massive "steps" every hour or so, re-saving position, etc to db every time


suggest faction
admirals for factions
change your faction
neutral faction
faction battles

AI faction?

commands
	status: 1-stop for ship status, needs, sensors

ascii graphics for radar(map) and such

sensors are a little opaque and unreliable until you upgrade

democratically elected roles

3 or 4 global factions

stats for servers
	ship name
	ship age
	health
		run out, and the server has to restart from a new ship
		but user skills carry through (although lessened a bit)
	credits
	shields
	fuel
	location (x, y, z, area name)
	velocity
	speed
	food (number of players)
		run out, and players get put into cryo-sleep until we can get more
		min 1 player left (captain)
	aggregate "levels" in each user skill

items
	tracker beacon (stick onto enemies)
	map
upgrades
	sensors
		text-based to ascii to images lol
		range
	enemy scanners
		ship size
		
	weapons

ship models

the first time a user uses a bot command, they're welcomed aboard the ship

user stats
	skills
		engineering (typing test)
		piloting (twitch plays pokemon aggregate of everyone's input)
	legacy (points for activity)
	rank (set by admin for privs)
	perks system (still start from 0 on death but level up faster)

servers have abilities that the members have trained

server member general tasks
	require trained skills
		operate radar
		fly ship
		fire weapons (coords)
		take evasive action
		repairs
		scan for X Y Z (trackers etc)
	anyone
		"gather" (solar, space junk, etc)
		start vote to kill crewmate?

when two servers encounter each other, 
	they can...
		pass like two ships in the night
		trade
		attack
		hire to perform task
			use item on other
		travel together
	add ship in THAT state to log

planets
	occasional encounters
	refuel
	buy/sell supplies
	repair
	upgrade ship
	depart
	bank - store or withdraw
	mining
	quests

exploration as a goal

every x units traveled, there's a random encounter?

treasure goblins

horde alliance garbled chat

only get 1 "action" per tick, but you can queue up actions

I feel like this should happen more in real-time rather than a fake "day" unit
ticks should just be arbitrary but not represent "days"

motion as amounts of thrust in any direction
captain has ebrake









This week, my server has been getting chased around by a much bigger Green faction ship!
They keep tracking our movements, and taking potshots at us whenever they can. Luckily, our pilots are pretty great, and they're keeping us mostly safe. Everyone else has been taking night classes in piloting to help us stay that way.
We took a crew vote and decided we needed to broadcast an SOS, hoping that a ship friendly to our Yellow faction would hear it and come to help.
There was a close call where the enemy took out our engines, and we had to get all hands on deck to repair them before the enemy could take out more of our equipment while we sat still, defenseless.
After weeks of playing cat-and-mouse and with our health ever-dwindling, we were on the verge of broadcasting a surrender signal and letting the pirates have their way with our stores.
Suddenly, two new ships appeared on our radar. A pair of Yellow faction ships traveling together from a nearby planet swooped down upon the Green ship, instantly bringing down its shields.
It used a teleport beacon to escape, but we didn't mind. We were just happy to be alive. We'll always be watching out for that ship from now on.
The Yellow ships helped us repair our broken engines, and told us about a planet only a few AU away. We went there all together, with the Yellow ships slowing down to match our limping pace.
Once we arrived, we discovered that our cargo was valued extremely highly on this planet! We offloaded our cargo and managed to make enough money to upgrade our ship with a slick new laser weapon â€” Green faction had better wach their backs.
I couldn't understand exactly what they were saying because they were Gray faction, but I think there's something interesting happening a few dozen AU from here. The crew seems ready, so we load back up and blast off, ready to face whatever comes.
